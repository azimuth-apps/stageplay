StagePlay is an unofficial client app written for the Stages Bike SB20. It uses the two (currently unused) buttons on the SB20 to control actions within the application. Currently, as of May 2022, it has the following features:

1. Play/Pause audio tracks
2. Skip audio track
3. (Zwift) Use power-up
4. (Zwift) Do a u-turn

These options are presented to the user on a menu, and the user can press the right button on the bike to shift to the next action, and the left button on the bike to select that action.

### Will it work for me, and my setup?

Possibly, but with some caveats:

* There are probably _hundreds of thousands_ of possible setups that exist in the world, with people owning different laptops, tablets, and some people building their own devices. While StagePlay works for me, you may experience a different result. As StagePlay is a project of mine and is not related to Stages Bike in any way, I cannot gaurentee compatibility
* I've only tested this with Zwift. There are a myriad of other solutions like TrainerRoad, Today's Plan, and so on and so forth. Each app and solution will have their own way of interacting with the SB20, which could present problems for StagePlay.


### Who made this?

**StagePlay is not made by Stages Bike, and is not associated in any way with them.** Originally, this was a project I had made to play/pause audio from my bike only, hence the name StagePlay seemed appropriate. I don't know how they feel about me writing software for their bike. They might like it, they might hate it, who knows?  I'm hoping they're a fan, but only time will tell. **Please don't contact Stages Bike for help with StagePlay**. Their support is pretty busy, and I think that people spamming them with questions about an app they didn't make will only make them hate me. Which is bad for everyone.

### If it has so many problems, why are you releasing it?

The biggest problem for StagePlay to overcome is the sheer amount of possible problems that it could encounter on a certain device combination. I need the help of the community to test StagePlay to understand if there are common problems or errors encountered, so I can implement fixes for those problems. Hopefully, there won't be too many problems and I can release a stable version of StagePlay before long.

### Is it going to be free?

During testing, StagePlay will be free. Once it is deemed stable, and we hit the 1.0 release, StagePlay will have a small registration fee. Everyone who participated in testing will be given a discount to thank them for the time they spent testing StagePlay.

This is due to the time and effort involved in understanding the protocols involved. The good news is though, charging a small fee for StagePlay means that I can set aside more and more time to work on it and improve it. That's good for everyone.

### Is this safe to use with my SB20? It cost a lot of money, you know

I have been using StagePlay for close to a month and I have not observed any adverse problems with my SB20.

**However**, StagePlay is not developed (and is not associated in any way) with Stages Bike. Because of that, it's difficult to gaurentee that it is safe to use with your Stages Bike. If I developed an app for a device that cost $50, I'd probably roll the dice and say that it should work fine for you. But because an SB20 costs literally thousands of dollars, there's quite a bit at stake, and I have to includ this disclaimer.

**For the abscence of doubt, StagePlay has not been developed by Stages Bike and cannot be gaurenteed to be safe to use for your individual setup. If you are not comfortable with this risk, please do not use StagePlay. By using StagePlay you agree that you are aware that it could possibly damage your bike.**

Thanks for using StagePlay!
